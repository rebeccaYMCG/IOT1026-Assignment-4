# IOT1026-Assignment-4
This program is a simple console application that allows users to input a sequence of commands to control a robot. The program prompts the user to enter six commands, which include turning the robot on or off and moving it in different directions (north, south, east, west). After receiving the commands, the program executes them one by one, displaying the robot's current position (coordinates) and power status. At the end of the program, it provides a history of the robot's movement, listing the coordinates it visited during the execution of the commands.
